# Contribution guide

The "interactive-examples" repository provides interactive examples for [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org).

If you're interested in contributing to this project, great! This file should help you get started.

## Types of contribution

There are many ways you can help improve this repository! For example:

* **Write a brand-new example:** for example, you might notice that there are no
examples for a particular [CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference).
* **Improve an existing example:** for example,
you might notice a problem with an existing example, or some way it could be made more helpful.
* **Fix a bug:** we have a list of [issues](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/issues),
or maybe you found your own.

This guide focuses on contributing examples, although we welcome contributions to the editor and infrastructure code as well.

## Setup

To contribute live examples all you need is a text editor, git, a GitHub account, and Nodejs.

As far as text/code editors go, there are more editors than you can shake a stick at, so it's down to personal preference. [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a great, open source editor we can definitely recommend.

For more information on setting up Git on your machine, [read this article](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

With the above dependencies satisfied, [create your new account on Github](https://github.com/join).

Lastly, [install Nodejs for your operating system](https://nodejs.org/).

### Fork and clone

Next up, you need to fork and clone the repo to be able to contribute to it. You can [learn about forking on Github](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo). Once you have your own fork, [clone it to your local machine](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).

Finally, change into the new directory created by the clone and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This will ensure that you have all the required development modules installed to build and test your contributions. You are now ready to contribute. Thank you o/\o

## Contributing a CSS example

### Writing the example
You start off by creating a new file inside `live-examples\css-examples\`. The name of this file should match the example you are adding. For example, if you are adding examples for [`border-radius`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) you would call the file `border-radius.html`.

Inside this newly created file, copy and paste the following code:

```
<section id="example-choice-list" class="example-choice-list large" data-property="border-radius">

    <div class="example-choice" initial-choice="true">
        <pre><code id="example_one" class="language-css">Your CSS goes here</code></pre>
        <button type="button" class="copy hidden" aria-hidden="true" data-clipboard-target="#example_one">
            <span class="visually-hidden">Copy to Clipboard</span>
        </button>
    </div>

</section>

<div id="output" class="output large hidden">
    <section id="default-example" class="default-example">
      <div id="example-element" class="transition-all"></div>
    </section>
</div>
```

This is the base starting point for all CSS examples.

It consists of two main pieces:

* **The example CSS**: the `section#example-choice-list` contains one or more `div.example-choice` elements. These are the choices that will be presented to the user on the left-hand side of the editor. Each choice contains some CSS declarations that will be applied to the example element when the user selects that choice.

* **The example element**: the `section#default-example` contains all the markup for the editor's output pane. At a minimum this will contain a node with `id="example-element"`: this is the element that the chosen example CSS will be applied to.

Let's fill this in for `border-radius`.

First, we'll specify the example element. For `border-radius` it makes sense to have a simple `<div>` element with a solid background color. The already present `div#example-element` will do. However, let's give it the text "Style Me":

```
<div id="output" class="output large hidden">
    <section id="default-example" class="default-example">
      <div id="example-element" class="transition-all">Style Me!</div>
    </section>
</div>
```

When it makes sense to do so, you can also supply additional DOM elements here. For example, the [`position`](https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/pages/css/position.html) example has one box which is the "example-element", but also includes extra boxes to show how setting the `position` property for an element interacts with the other elements in a layout.

Next, let's add the example CSS choices. Think of a few different ways that `border-radius` can be specified. For each of these, create a new `div.example-choice` element nested inside `section#example-choice-list`. For example:

```
<section id="example-choice-list" class="example-choice-list large" data-property="border-radius">

    <div class="example-choice" initial-choice="true">
        <pre><code id="example_one" class="language-css">border-radius: 10px;</code></pre>
        <button type="button" class="copy hidden" aria-hidden="true" data-clipboard-target="#example_one">
            <span class="visually-hidden">Copy to Clipboard</span>
        </button>
    </div>

    <div class="example-choice">
        <pre><code id="example_two" class="language-css">border-radius: 10px 50%;</code></pre>
        <button type="button" class="copy hidden" aria-hidden="true" data-clipboard-target="#example_one">
            <span class="visually-hidden">Copy to Clipboard</span>
        </button>
    </div>

    <div class="example-choice">
        <pre><code id="example_three" class="language-css">border-radius: 10px 5px 6em / 20px 25px 30%;</code></pre>
        <button type="button" class="copy hidden" aria-hidden="true" data-clipboard-target="#example_one">
            <span class="visually-hidden">Copy to Clipboard</span>
        </button>
    </div>

</section>
```

This will give us three different choices. Note that each choice gets its own ID: `example_one`, `example_two`, `example_three` and so on. You can choose which option will be shown at first by setting the `initial-choice` attribute to `true` (only one choice should have this).

Now we've finished writing the HTML for the example. The final version of `border-radius.html` should look like this:

```
<section id="example-choice-list" class="example-choice-list large" data-property="border-radius">

    <div class="example-choice" initial-choice="true">
        <pre><code id="example_one" class="language-css">border-radius: 10px;</code></pre>
        <button type="button" class="copy hidden" aria-hidden="true" data-clipboard-target="#example_one">
            <span class="visually-hidden">Copy to Clipboard</span>
        </button>
    </div>

    <div class="example-choice">
        <pre><code id="example_two" class="language-css">border-radius: 10px 50%;</code></pre>
        <button type="button" class="copy hidden" aria-hidden="true" data-clipboard-target="#example_one">
            <span class="visually-hidden">Copy to Clipboard</span>
        </button>
    </div>

    <div class="example-choice">
        <pre><code id="example_three" class="language-css">border-radius: 10px 5px 6em / 20px 25px 30%;</code></pre>
        <button type="button" class="copy hidden" aria-hidden="true" data-clipboard-target="#example_one">
            <span class="visually-hidden">Copy to Clipboard</span>
        </button>
    </div>

</section>

<div id="output" class="output large hidden">
    <section id="default-example" class="default-example">
      <div id="example-element" class="transition-all">Style Me!</div>
    </section>
</div>
```

When you're writing examples, please make sure that they conform to the [CSS Example Style Guide](CSS-Example-Style-Guide.md).

### Styling the example
Next, let's provide some extra styling for the example element. Create a new CSS file inside `live-examples\css-examples\css\`. Call this CSS file the same as the HTML file i.e. `border-radius.css`. Add the following code to it:

```
#example-element {
    background-color: #74992E;
    width: 250px;
    height: 80px;
}
```

### Updating the metadata
Next, you need to tell the page generator about your new page and its dependencies. To do this, open up the `site.json` file in the root of the project folder. Under `pages`, find an existing entry with a `type` of `css`.

Copy and paste the example then update it to apply to your new example, noting that pages are grouped by `type`, and then alphabetically for each `type`. You entry will look something like this when edited:

```
"borderRadius": {
    "baseTmpl": "tmpl/live-css-tmpl.html",
    "cssExampleSrc": "../../live-examples/css-examples/css/border-radius.css",
    "exampleCode": "live-examples/css-examples/border-radius.html",
    "fileName": "border-radius.html",
    "type": "css"
},
```

### Testing
All that remains is to test that your page generates and displays as intended, then open a pull request for review.

From your command line run:

```
npm run build
```

Once this completes run:

```
npm start
```

Now point your browser to [localhost:8080/pages/css/border-radius.html](http://localhost:8000/pages/css/border-radius.html).

Once satisfied with the example, [submit your pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Contributing a JavaScript example

### Writing the exaple
With a JavaScript example you start by creating a new `.html` file in `live-examples/js-examples`. The same naming convention applies here as it does for CSS. In this example we are going to contribute an example demonstrating the use of `Array.from` so, we'll create a new file called `array-from.html`.

Next, you need to paste the following code into this new file (this will be the same for all JavaScript examples you add):

```
<pre>
<code id="static-js" class="language-js">
</code>
</pre>
```

Inside the `code` block is where our example code will go. Change the code to read as follows:

```
<pre>
<code id="static-js">// call from(), passing a string
let result = Array.from('foo');

// log the result
console.log(result);
</code>
</pre>
```

Please make sure the example conforms to the [JS Example Style Guide](JS-Example-Style-Guide.md).

### Updating the metadata
All that remains is to tell the page generator about our new example. To do this, open up `site.json` at the root of the project folder. Under `pages`, find an existing entry with a `type` of `js`.

Copy and paste the example then update it to your new example, noting that pages are grouped by `type`, and then alphabetically for each `type`.

You entry will look something like the following when edited:

```
"arrayFrom": {
    "baseTmpl": "tmpl/live-js-tmpl.html",
    "exampleCode": "live-examples/js-examples/array-from.html",
    "fileName": "array-from.html",
    "title": "JavaScript Demo: Array.from()",
    "type": "js"
},
```

### Testing
From your command line run:

```
npm run build
```

Once this completes run:

```
npm start
```

Point your browser to:

[localhost:8080/pages/js/array-from.html](http://localhost:8000/pages/js/array-from.html)

Once satisfied with the example, [submit your pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
