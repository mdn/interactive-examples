# Contributing a JavaScript example

## Writing the example

With a JavaScript example you start by creating a new `.js` file in a subfolder of `live-examples/js-examples`. In this example we are going to contribute an example demonstrating the use of `Array.from`, so we'll create a new file called `array-from.js`. Since it is part of the `Array` object, we're going to put it inside the "array" subfolder.

Inside this file we'll write the example code:

```js
const result = Array.from('foo');

console.log(result);
// expected output: Array [ "f", "o", "o" ]
```

Please make sure the example conforms to the [JS Example Style Guide](JS-Example-Style-Guide.md).

## Updating the metadata

All that remains is to tell the page generator about our new example. To do this, open up `meta.json` in the current folder (i.e. at "./live-examples/js-examples/array/meta.json"). This file contains a single JSON object `pages`, with one property for each example. Add a property for the new example, keeping the properties of `pages` in alphabetical order:

```
"arrayFrom": {
    "exampleCode": "./live-examples/js-examples/array/array-from.js",
    "fileName": "array-from.html",
    "title": "JavaScript Demo: Array.from()",
    "type": "js"
},
```

The `title` property is displayed above the editor, and should be of the form: "JavaScript Demo: {item}", where {item} is the name of the item that the example is for. If you're not sure what to use for {item}, use the title of the page.

Once you've finished writing the example, see the [Testing](CONTRIBUTING.md#testing) section for the next step.
