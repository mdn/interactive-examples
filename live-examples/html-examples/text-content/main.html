    <p>Geckos are a group of usually small, usually nocturnal lizards. They are found on every continent except Australia.</p>
    <p>Many species of gecko have adhesive toe pads which enable them to climb walls and even windows. Some species, such as the Common house gecko <i>Hemidactylus frenatus</i>, have adapted to live in houses where they hunt small insects attracted by artificial light.</p>
