        This is a scrollable container. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn
        Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the
        face of the earth.

        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
        galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
        the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

          This is the inner container. Focus on this container, scroll to the right and when you reach the right edge
          keep scrolling.
          <p>
            If you have <code class="language-css">overscroll-behavior-x: auto;</code> selected the outer container will
            start to scroll.
          </p>
          If you have <code class="language-css">overscroll-behavior-x: contain;</code> selected, the outer container
          will not scroll unless you move your cursor out of the inner container and try to perform scroll on the outer
          container. **Note that this applies only to the x-axis. You should still be able to scroll past in the y-axis.
