# Reviewing guide

All reviewers must abide by the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md); they are also protected by the code of conduct.
A reviewer should not tolerate poor behavior and is encouraged to [report any behavior](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#Reporting_violations) that violates the code of conduct.

## Review process

The MDN Web Docs team has a well-defined review process that must be followed by reviewers in all repositories under the GitHub MDN organization.
This process is described in detail on the [Pull request guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Pull_requests) page.
