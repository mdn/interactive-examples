# Reviewing guide

## Values and guidelines

All reviewers must abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md); they are also protected by the Code of Conduct.
A reviewer should not tolerate poor behavior and is encouraged to [report any behavior](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#Reporting_violations) that violates the Code of Conduct.

Everyone participating must follow our [Community Participation Guidelines](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#Community_Participation_Guidelines)

## Review process

The MDN Web Docs team has a well-defined review process that must be followed by reviewers in all repositories under the GitHub MDN organization.
This process is described in detail on the [Pull request guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Pull_requests) page.

<!--

  TODO: If there are any guidelines on review processes not covered by the contribution pages at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Pull_requests, either:
  * Check if they should be added to the contribution pages if they should apply to all repositories, or
  * Add them to this section below if they are unique to this repository only.
